Lab 1 Pseudo-Code

1. Initialize Variables
- Initialize grossPay as a float.
- Initialize netPay as a float.
- Initialize socSecTax as a float. (6.20%)
- Initialize deduction as a float.
- Initialize hoursWorked as a float.
- Initialize payRate as a float.

2. User Input
- How many hours did you work this week? (hoursWorked)
- What is your hourly pay rate? (payRate)

3. Calculate Results
- Multiply hoursWorked and payRate to get grossPay.
- Multiple grossPay by socSecTax to get deduction.
- Subtract deduction from grossPay to get netPay.

4. Print Results with Informative Labels
- Print weekly summary showing: hours worked, pay rate, gross pay, deduction and net pay.
